[This](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) is a Coursera specialization for intermediate programmers which consists of 6 courses. Individuals with proficiency in any programming language can take this course. They offer starter files in various programming languages but further ahead in course, they provide starter files only in C++, Java and Python3.

This specialization is a deep dive into various algorithms, data sructures and their applications. It is being taught by:
* UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO
* NATIONAL RESEARCH UNIVERSITY HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS.

This is an excellent course so far and highly recommended if you are gravely interested in studying Data Structures and Algorithms.

The code samples are in Python3. These are the implementations of some problems that are part of this specialization.
