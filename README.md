# Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization
[This](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) is a Coursera specialization for intermediate programmers. Students with proficiency in any one programming languages can take this course. However, further ahead in course, they provide startere files in C++, Java and Python3.

This specialization is a deep dive into various algorithms, data sructures and their applications. It is being taught by:
* UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO
* NATIONAL RESEARCH UNIVERSITY HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS.

This is an excellent course so far and highly recommended if you are highly interested in studying Data Structures and Algorithms.

The code samples are in Python3. These are my implementation of some problems that are part of this specialization.
